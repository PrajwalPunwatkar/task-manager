# 📘 Task Manager Web App – Frontend Integration with Spring Boot REST API

## 🎯 Objective

This project demonstrates how to build a simple task management web application that integrates a frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) with a backend REST API built using Spring Boot. It allows users to view and add tasks dynamically using the Fetch API.

## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to explore how frontend applications can consume REST APIs in real time, and how Spring Boot can serve both backend logic and static frontend files. This project helped me understand:

- How to structure a Spring Boot project with REST endpoints  
- How to serve static HTML/CSS/JS from Spring Boot  
- How to use the Fetch API to interact with backend services  
- How to dynamically update the DOM with JSON data  

It’s a foundational step toward building full-stack applications with persistent storage and advanced features.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot (`spring-boot-starter-web`)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API)  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Build Tool:** Maven  
- **Data Storage:** In-memory list (no database required)

---

## 🚀 Features

- View all tasks (GET `/tasks`)  
- Add a new task (POST `/tasks`)  
- Dynamically refresh task list after adding  
- Clean and responsive UI using vanilla CSS  
- No database required—runs instantly

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to scaffold a Spring Boot REST API
- How to serve static frontend files from resources/static
- How to use fetch() for GET and POST requests
- How to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript
- How to narrate and package a project for sharing
